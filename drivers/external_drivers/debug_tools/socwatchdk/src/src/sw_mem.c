 * MAGIC number based memory tracker. Relies on
 * storing (a) a MAGIC marker and (b) the requested
 * size WITHIN the allocated block of memory. Standard
 * malloc-tracking stuff, really.
 *
 * Overview:
 * (1) ALLOCATION:
 * When asked to allocate a block of 'X' bytes, allocate
 * 'X' + 8 bytes. Then, in the FIRST 4 bytes, write the
 * requested size. In the NEXT 4 bytes, write a special
 * (i.e. MAGIC) number to let our deallocator know that
 * this block of memory was allocated using this technique.
 * Also, keep track of the number of bytes allocated.
 *
 * (2) DEALLOCATION:
 * When given an object to deallocate, we first check
 * the MAGIC number by decrementing the pointer by
 * 4 bytes and reading the (integer) stored there.
 * After ensuring the pointer was, in fact, allocated
 * by us, we then read the size of the allocated
 * block (again, by decrementing the pointer by 4
 * bytes and reading the integer size). We
 * use this size argument to decrement # of bytes
 * allocated.
