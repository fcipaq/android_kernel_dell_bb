menuconfig RAWIO
	tristate "Debug fs based raw io device read/write framework "
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	default y 
	help
	  This option enables support for reading or writing registers/memory
	  region in a io device via debug fs.
	  With this option and related rawio driver options enabled, you could
	  read configuration space of a PCI device, registers of a memory
	  mapped or port mapped device, registers of a i2c device, etc.
	  This is the just the framework driver. You need enable more
	  options to support specific device types.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M: the module will
	  be called rawio.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.
