config GPIO_INTEL_MSIC
	bool "Intel MSIC GPIO support"
	depends on INTEL_SCU_IPC && GPIOLIB
	---help---
	  MSIC provides a GPIO subsystem containing several input
	  output pins.
	  Say Y here to support GPIO via the SCU IPC interface
	  on Intel MID platforms.

config INTEL_MID_OSNIB_ILB
        tristate "cmos osnib driver for Intel BYT platforms"
	depends on INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET
        default n
        ---help---
			This driver adds OSNIB support using CMOS.
			OSNIB is used to share flags between firmware and kernel.
			This is only valid when no SCU is present.

			If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_MID_OSIP
	tristate "osip driver for Intel MID platforms"
	default y
	help
	  This driver modifies the osip header when rebooting,
	  so that one can type 'reboot bootloader' to fall back
	  in kboot mode.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_MID_OSIP_DEBUG_FS
	tristate "osip driver debug fs"
	depends on INTEL_MID_OSIP && DEBUG_FS
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds debugfs interface.
	  The main feature of that interface is to be able to modify the kernel
	  cmdline directly in the OSIP.
	  This has to be disabled if we have secure boot enabled by default.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_PSH_IPC
	bool "Intel PSH IPC Support"
	depends on X86_INTEL_MID
	---help---
	  PSH(Platform Services Hub) is a low frequence IA core on Tangier Platform,
	  whose power consumption is quite low. PSH runs RTOS software inside itself,
	  which independently controls and collects sensor data, pre-processes the data,
	  and communicates with Atom. Thus ATOM side could be put into low power mode
	  with more time, while all the sensor data are collected without any lost.

	  PSH IPC is used as a  bridge for OS sensor service to control and access PSH
	  sensors communications between kernel and PSH. This is not needed for PC-type
	  machines.

	  Say Y here to get Intel PSH IPC support.

config INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET
	bool "Intel Reboot Target"
	---help---
	  This driver provides a generic implementation for reboot target setting at
	  reset time.

config INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET_PSH_DEBUG
	depends on INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET
	bool "Enable PSH-debug target"
	default n
	---help---
	  Reboot Target which PSH debug port is enabled.

config INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET_SCU_DEBUG
	depends on INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET
	bool "Enable scu-debug target"
	default n
	---help---
	  Reboot Target which scu debug port is enabled.

config INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET_CHANGE_PORT
	depends on INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET
	bool "Enable debug-crd target"
	default n
	---help---
	  Reboot Target which spi debug port is enabled.

config INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET_UEFI
	tristate "Intel Target Mode UEFI implementation"
	depends on INTEL_REBOOT_TARGET && EFI && !MID_OSNIB_ILB
	---help---
	  Reboot Target UEFI based implementation
